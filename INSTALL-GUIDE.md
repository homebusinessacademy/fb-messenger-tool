## Tips for Success

1. **Don't use Facebook Messenger** while messages are being sent — let the tool do its thing
2. **Be patient** — the tool is intentionally slow to avoid Facebook flags
3. **Check your inbox** — respond promptly when friends reply!
4. **Get them your link** — when someone says "Yes", send them your HBA link

## Troubleshooting
